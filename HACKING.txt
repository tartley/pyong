Development environment
=======================

The Makefile is not required for anything - but it is a great cheatsheet of
the commands I use most commonly while developing this project. I'm running
these commands from either a Windows prompt with Cygwin binaries on the path,
or else a Bash prompt in Ubuntu.

Tests use Michael Foord's packages unittest2 and mock. Run the tests using::

    unit2 discover
